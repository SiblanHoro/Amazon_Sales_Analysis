# Amazon Sales Analysis – Power BI + SQL Project

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon's retail sales data using **SQL for data exploration** and **Power BI for visualization**. It provides business insights such as revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To perform end-to-end data analysis on Amazon retail sales using SQL and present it through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

---

## 📂 Technologies Used

- **SQL Server** – Data Cleaning, Exploration & Querying
- **Power BI** – Dashboard Design, Visualization & DAX Measures

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset includes information on:

- Invoice details (ID, Branch, City)
- Customer Type and Gender
- Product Line, Unit Price, Quantity
- Tax, Total Sales, COGS, Gross Income
- Date, Time, Payment Mode, Ratings

---

## 🔎 SQL Tasks Performed

- Total sales and quantity sold
- Average rating per product line
- City and branch wise performance
- Top selling product lines
- Customer type segmentation
- Date-wise sales trend

(SQL queries are available in the `/SQL/` folder)
Create Database Amazon_Sales
USE Amazon_Sales

Select * from Amazon

---Tasks 1. Find the total revenue generated by each product line for each gender
```sql
SELECT Product_line,
       Gender,
	   SUM(Total) AS Total_revenue
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY Product_line, Gender
```
---Task 2. Identify the top 2 branches with the highest total gross income.
```sql
SELECT TOP 2 Branch,
      SUM(gross_income) AS Total_income
FROM Amazon 
GROUP BY Branch
ORDER BY Total_income DESC
```
---Task 3. Calculate the month over month change in revenue

```sql
WITH MonthlyRevenue AS (
SELECT DATENAME(mm, Date) AS Months,
       SUM(Total) AS Revenue
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY DATENAME(mm, Date)
)
SELECT curr.Months,
       curr.Revenue,
	   prev.revenue AS Prev_Revenue,
	   curr.Revenue - Prev_Revenue AS Change
FROM MonthlyRevenue AS curr
LEFT JOIN MonthlyRevenue AS prev
   ON prev.Months = curr.Months
```
---Task 4. Generate A running total of revenue over time (based on the date column).
```sql
SELECT Date, 
       SUM(Total) OVER(ORDER BY Date) AS Running_Total
FROM Amazon
```
---Task 5. Calculate the percentage of total sales made using each payment method 
```sql
SELECT Payment,
       COUNT(*) AS transactions,
	   ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Amazon), 2) AS Percentage
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY Payment;
```sql
---Task 6. List all transactions where the rating is heigher than the average rating across all transaction 
```sql
SELECT * FROM Amazon
WHERE Rating > (SELECT AVG(Rating) FROM Amazon) 
```sql
---Task 7. Find the best-performing product line in terms of revenue for each branch
```sql
SELECT B.Branch,
       B.Product_line,
	   B.Revenue
FROM (
    SELECT Branch,
           Product_line,
	       SUM(Total) AS Revenue
    FROM Amazon
    GROUP BY Branch, Product_line
) AS B
WHERE B.Revenue = (
    SELECT MAX(Revenue)
    FROM (
	   SELECT Branch,
	          Product_line,
			  SUM(Total) AS Revenue
	   FROM Amazon
	   GROUP BY Branch, Product_line
	) SUB
	WHERE SUB.Branch = B.Branch
)
```sql
---Task 8. For each city, identify the most frequent customer type 
```sql
WITH Ranked As(
SELECT City, 
       Customer_type,     
       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY City ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) 
AS rnk
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY City, Customer_type
)
SELECT City, Customer_type
FROM Ranked 
WHERE rnk = 1
```
---Task 9. find the date with higest totol gross income
```sql
SELECT TOP 1
       SUM(Gross_income) AS Highest_gross_income,
	   Date
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY Date
ORDER BY Highest_gross_income DESC
```sql
---Task 10. For each product line, compare each unit price with the average unit price of that product line 
```sql
SELECT Invoice_ID,
       Product_line,
       Unit_price,
	   AVG(Unit_price) OVER(PARTITION BY Product_line) AS Avg_Unit_price,
	   Unit_price - AVG(Unit_price) OVER(PARTITION BY  Product_line) AS Diff
FROM Amazon
```                            
---Task 11. Analyze the total income and number of transactions each customer type per branch.
```sql
SELECT Customer_type,
       Branch,
       SUM(gross_income) AS Income,
       COUNT(*) AS trans
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY Customer_type, Branch
```
---Task 12. Identify if there any duplicate invoice ids in the dataset 
```sql
SELECT Invoice_ID, 
       COUNT(Invoice_ID) AS Dup_Invoice
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY Invoice_ID
HAVING COUNT(Invoice_ID) > 1
```
---Task 13. Determine the top 3 dates with the most number of transations.
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 Date,
       COUNT(*) AS Num_of_trans
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY Date
ORDER BY Num_of_trans DESC;
```
-----Task 14. Show the cumulative quantity sold over time for each product line 
```sql
SELECT Product_line,
       Date,
	   Quantity,
	   SUM(Quantity) OVER(PARTITION BY Product_line ORDER BY Date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS Cumulative_qty
FROM Amazon
```
---Task 15. Get the distribution of genders for each payment method.
```sql
SELECT Payment,
       Gender,
	   COUNT(*) AS Cnt
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY Payment, Gender
```
---Task 16. Find transaction where the total amount exceeds the 90 percentile of all transaction totals.
```sql
WITH T90 AS (
         SELECT PERCENTILE_CNT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP 
		 (ORDER BY Total) AS T90_val
		 FROM Amazon
		 )
SELECT A.*
FROM Amazon AS A 
CROSS JOIN T90
WHERE A.Total > T90_val
```
---Task 17. Identify all days where total sales were below the average daily sales

       SUM(Total) AS Sales
FROM Amazon 
GROUP BY Date
HAVING SUM(Total) < (SELECT AVG(Total) FROM Amazon)
```
---Task 18. List all transactions that have the maximum quantity sold in a single transaction.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Amazon
WHERE Quantity = (SELECT MAX(Quantity) FROM Amazon)
```
---Task 19. Calculate the average COGS per product line for each month
```sql
SELECT Product_line,
       DATENAME(mm, Date) AS Months,
	   AVG(Cogs) AS Avgcogs
FROM Amazon
GROUP BY DATENAME(mm, Date), product_line
```
---Task 20. Rank all cities based on their total revenue
